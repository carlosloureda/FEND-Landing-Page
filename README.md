# Landing Page Project

A landing page project for mastering JS & CSS on the Front End Nanodegree for Udacity.
We are viewing some basic content for the nanodegree. We will keep things easy and on the future I will create some branches or side projects with more advanced functionalities for builing some independant courses for my mentoring sessions

## Installation

This project works without any framework so you only need to download the code and open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## About

The purpose of this project is to have a dinamic landing page that creates a navbar for each section added to this landing page using Javascript.

I am going to fake some content fetched from an API, but it will just be delivered from local code (mocked data), but I will keep in mind the best practices for real projects.
