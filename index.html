        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>
          Co-founding my own startup, in which I started as a worker and sole
          developer, I have been able to understand the needs that requires an
          ambitious project. Once the company settled, I have led teams of up to
          10 people to develop up to 3 different products at once.

        <h2>Mentoring</h2>
        <p>
          I have always liked to exchange knowledge and get to know different
          points of view. This past year I have developed these skills as a
          React/Redux/React Native mentor in Udacity as well as in my locality.
          Something that continues to allow me to grow by learning from others.

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          The web came first, but how it's evolving! We have to adapt to these
          times when Javascript is advancing and improving the way we set up our
          websites. Nowadays we have to talk about JAMStack, GraphQL,
          monorepositories and more topics.

        <h2>Mobile Development</h2>
        <p>
          The development of an ecosystem based on mobile applications is
          increasingly necessary. It is no longer enough to have a website, now
          we have to provide real multiplatform solutions. We can make
          developments that run perfectly in both Android and iOS
