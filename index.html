            React/Redux/React Native mentor in Udacity as well as in my

          friend! There is no doubt that he has made Domesting a dynamic and fun
          place to work and where everyone can participate. He has great
          qualities to lead a team but what he stands out for is his personal
          skills, he always tries to be fair in his decisions by empathizing
          with people and reaching a consensus. He has managed to create an
          organized and competent technical team, always promoting the work and
          effort of the youngest and helping them to grow in their careers. His
          joy and commitment have managed to infect the whole team with the
          necessary enthusiasm for the project to go ahead even at the lowest
          moments. I am taking a friend with me for life and I hope that in the

          Carlos is clearly interested in helping anyone grow in their career.
          As a Domesting CTO, his energy, team organization and dedication to
          the project predominate. Together, we have managed to create, from the
          technical point of view, a good application without much prior
          knowledge about the technologies, but this did not pose any problem
          for him since he is capable of adapting to any obstacle. It's nice to
          have someone on your side who is so interested in what's new in the
          sector, so it's impossible to become obsolete.

          Carlos has been, without a doubt, an indispensable pillar for the
          success of Domesting. He is a tireless worker, with an admirable
          passion for his work. His dedication and commitment even at the lowest
          moments have infected us with the necessary enthusiasm for the project
          to go ahead. With his preparation and technical skills beyond any
          doubt, I want to highlight his personal skills. He is a colleague with
          great empathy, always ready to help the rest of the team. His optimism
          has allowed him to maintain an ideal working environment. But, really,
          if anything has captivated me about Carlos during my time at
          Domesting, it has been both his organizational capacity and his
          leadership skills. He has known how to assume responsibilities in the
          most critical moments, taking decisions firmly and facilitating the
          understanding of the objectives throughout the organization. He has
          always fought for team cohesion and the involvement of all
          departments. It has created a technical team that is up to the task,
          promoting the proactivity of the youngest and getting involved in the
          training of its employees, motivating them and guiding them in their
          professional growth. He has proven himself capable of getting the most
          out of his teams, maintains a high level of exigency while providing
          security and makes you feel valued, something for which his colleagues
          remember him with great esteem. At his side, I've learned that
          dedication and sacrifice always have results. I want my future job to
          bring me more bosses (and friends) like hi.

          I would like to write a recommendation that will help Carlos achieve
          what he is proposing at the moment at a professional level, but I
          doubt that he can compete with his own persistence. Carlos is a
          tireless worker, who is always looking for a way to surpass himself,
          others, and mainly to surprise with solutions in the most unexpected
          moments. I would not hesitate to have him as a partner and I am left
          with the desire to be able to undertake something in common. Who
          knows..
