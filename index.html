        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>
          Co-founding my own startup, in which I started as a worker and sole
          developer, I have been able to understand the needs that requires an
          ambitious project. Once the company settled, I have led teams of up to
          10 people to develop up to 3 different products at once.

        <h2>Mentoring</h2>
        <p>
          I have always liked to exchange knowledge and get to know different
          points of view. This past year I have developed these skills as a
          React/Redux/React Native mentor in Udacity as well as in my locality.
          Something that continues to allow me to grow by learning from others.

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          The web came first, but how it's evolving! We have to adapt to these
          times when Javascript is advancing and improving the way we set up our
          websites. Nowadays we have to talk about JAMStack, GraphQL,
          monorepositories and more topics.

        <h2>Mobile Development</h2>
        <p>
          The development of an ecosystem based on mobile applications is
          increasingly necessary. It is no longer enough to have a website, now
          we have to provide real multiplatform solutions. We can make
          developments that run perfectly in both Android and iOS

          At my previous startup (Domesting SL) as co-founder I had to transform
          the previous solution for domestic cleaning services into a solution
          for the cleaning companies. With connect we didn't focus only only on
          freelancer cleaners, we added a solution for all kind of cleaning
          companies and facilities.

          The crown jewel. The definitive solution for the management of

          co-founded. At that time I was the unique developer in the first
          stages of the company. I built a complete website to provide final
          users and domestic cleaner a tool for them to manage the domesting
          cleaning services.
